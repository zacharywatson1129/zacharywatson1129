## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zachary Watson, a CS graduate and a developer for almost 7 years. I've worked most of that time with C#,
but I've also built some small things with Java and Python. I've also worked quite a bit in C/C++ and CUDA. 
I enjoy building desktop applications and designing user interfaces that are clean, simple, and effective.
I like all stages of software development, from concept to deployment. I hope to get a job as C# or .NET Developer.
