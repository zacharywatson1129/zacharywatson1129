## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm Zachary Watson, a CS graduate and a developer for almost 7 years. I've worked most of that time with C#,
but I've also built some small things with Java and Python. I've also worked quite a bit in C/C++ and CUDA. 
I enjoy building desktop applications and designing user interfaces that are clean, simple, and effective.
I like all stages of software development, from concept to deployment. I hope to get a job as C# or .NET Developer. 

## Skills
### Programming Languages:
- C/C++
- C#
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript

### C# Technologies I have experience with:
- Windows Forms
- Windows Presentation Foundation
- SQLite
- Dapper
- Caliburn.Micro

## Projects
### C#
A few desktop applications I've built with C# include:
- my current work, my painting manager application, located here: https://github.com/zacharywatson1129/Painting-Manager. This project came out of my need to manage my oil painting hobby. I enjoy oil painting, and I had quite a few paintings, but I wasn't sure of the date when I painted them, and at the time I also had an interest in trying to make money out of selling my paintings. For all of this before, I had been printing thumbnails of my paintings on sheets of paper, then cutting them out and gluing them in a spiral notebook. But, being the 21st century, I decided there must be something better, and decided to marry my creative interests and programming interests to build a program to let me do that. And the Painting Details Manager was born. 
- my advanced screenshot tool, MySnipItTool, located here: https://github.com/zacharywatson1129/MySnipItTool. This tool was developed out my need to take multiple screenshots, but I was annoyed at having to save screenshots between taking new ones. I wanted all of the features of the Snipping Tool, and then some. So, I developed MySnipItTool, a multi-tabular screen capturing program with advanced annotation tools, including rectangle, ellipse, and text tools.

### Java
I learned the basics of Java before I even wrote 'Hello World' in C#. However, as soon I found C#, I mostly abandoned Java as my main programming language. I do, however, have a few small projects I have created:
- a Todo list manager, see here: https://github.com/zacharywatson1129/FX-To-Do-List-Manager. This application is a very simple to-do list application that allows for the creation of to-do list items with a description, priority, and status (which you can toggle). It features a JavaFX GUI with the UI defined in FXML and the code-behind defined in its own file. The application uses SQLite to store to-do items. There is very basic error handling in place, with alerts set up if users have not selected a to-do item but try to delete one, for example. 
- a cash register/online computer store simulation, see here: https://github.com/zacharywatson1129/CashRegisterManager. This simulates a computer store, where you can buy laptops, desktops, and other accessories. The application is simply a console program, as I had a limited time frame to create the program since it was the final project for my undergraduate Java course. However, some of my achievements with this was a strong, reusable library. The application has different user account levels, such as admin and customer accounts. The code is broken up into various packages, with user interface logic separate from I/O helper classes. For organization and to mimic how a GUI application might be structured, different menus/screens are created in their own classes, again, in their own UI package. 

### Research
Beyond my pure software development background, I also have dived into the computational mathematics world, and have one publication under my belt, which you can see here:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772828524000475.
My main work here was in further developing an N-body simulation of complex (dusty) plasmas, or plasmas with foreign nano-micrometer sized particles (dust). We aimed to model
torsions, pairs of dust grains that spin in an elliptical pattern spontaneously within dust crystals. Our hope was that our computational model could aid physicists in understanding torsions in more depth as well as provide a general model for other areas of research. The model was a C/C++ program, with OpenGL used for graphics. The code was made to run in parallel on NVIDIA GPUs using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). Some of my key contributions included breaking the monolithic two-kernel code into four kernels, creating a visualization aid for parent-child dust pairs, and designing and coding our multi-child charge inheritance scheme. Beyond my programming efforts, I designed presentations and posters and delivered talks at various undergraduate and regional research symposiums, including Texas Oklahoma Regional Undergraduate Symposium (TORUS) 2023, Mathematical Association of America (MAA), and 6th Annual Meeting of the SIAM Texas-Louisiana Section (TXLA23). I was also a primary author of the paper mentioned above.
